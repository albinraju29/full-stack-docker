# Full Stack Docker

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to containerize a full-stack web application using Docker. It comprises:

- **Backend**: A RESTful API built with Express.js and Node.js.
- **Frontend**: A React application.
- **Docker Compose**: To orchestrate and manage multi-container Docker applications.

## Features

- **Backend**:
  - Provides a REST API to manage a list of fruits.
  - Endpoints:
    - `GET /api/items`: Fetch all items.
    - `POST /api/items`: Add a new item.

- **Frontend**:
  - A React application that interacts with the backend API.
  - Allows users to view and add fruits to the list.

- **Docker**:
  - Each service (frontend and backend) is containerized using Docker.
  - Docker Compose is used to build and run the multi-container application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/albinraju29/full-stack-docker.git
   cd full-stack-docker
````

2. **Build and start the application**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will:

   * Build the Docker images for both frontend and backend.
   * Start the containers as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

3. **Access the application**:

   * Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   * Backend API: [http://localhost:3001/api/items](http://localhost:3001/api/items)

4. **Stop the application**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Docker Hub Images

The Docker images for this project are available on Docker Hub:

### ðŸ“Œ Notes:

- **Backend**: The Express.js server listens on port 3001 and provides API endpoints to manage a list of fruits.
- **Frontend**: The React application interacts with the backend API to display and add fruits.
- **Docker Compose**: The `docker-compose.yml` file orchestrates the building and running of both frontend and backend services.

Feel free to customize this README further based on any additional features or configurations you might have in your project.
